<h1 id=top>Hi, I'm Melissa!</h1> 

<h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meisenmann/">Marketing campaign developer (email and direct mail)</a> with a wide variety of experiences and skills, who likes solving problems and finding answers.</h2>

<h2>Background:</h2>

I worked 13 1/2 years in marketing campaign development (both email and direct mail) until I was laid off in March 2024 as part of a restructuring of the Sales and Marketing teams. I have been involved with many parts of the email campaign process. See the bottom of this page for the very long [list](#MyJobs).

After some soul-searching, I realized how much I miss writing and running SQL code. Though it started as at least half of my previous job, there was less and less as I moved to different accounts. If my next job could include more SQL, that would make me very happy. That could be in another email campaign developer job or a data analyst job. 
<br/><br/>
In the meantime, while I look for a new job, I'm going to work on learning the technologies that show up often in data analyst job requirements, but that I don't know yet. I will also work to further my SQL knowledge, because there is always more to learn. Git and GitHub will allow me to share the projects I work on.

<h2>🚧 Post-Layoff Projects for Professional Development:</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
  - French noun gender flashcard program - GitHub repo link coming soon
  - TBD


<h2> 🔭 Programs & Technology I Plan to Learn: </h2>

- <b>Tableau</b>: I've only used Tableau Reader <br/>
- <b>Power BI</b>: I've only set up extracts to go to a Power BI set-up
- <b>R</b>: I have no experience yet with this.
- <b>SAS</b>: I've had a little exposure to this and still have my notes from 3-4 training sessions in 2014, but I have not had the opportunity to try again until now.
- <b>Markdown</b>: I already know traditional HTML but Markdown is just different enough to be slightly frustrating. However, creating ReadMe files for GitHub will definitely help me.


<h2> 🌱 Programs & Technology I Have Recently Begun to Learn: </h2>

- <b>Python</b>: I've been introduced to it so it's time to practice that knowledge with some more projects so that I can add this to the Skills section on my resume.
- <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b>: Admittedly, this is even newer to me, but as I develop projects with other technologies, this will be where I share that work and concurrently improve my git skills.


<h2> 👩‍💻 Programs & Technology I Already Know:</h2>

- <b>SQL</b>: I learned PL/SQL first and then SQL Server. The latter is what I've used more in the past few years. I have minimal experience with Redshift. My experience with all of them has primarily been in writing and running queries, importing and exporting data, etc.
- <b>Microsoft Office</b>: Excel is my favorite product in the Office Suite but I've used the rest of them including PowerPoint, SharePoint, SharePoint Designer, and Access.
- <b>HTML</b>: My comfort level with CSS could use some bolstering but I've spent a lot of time with HTML over the past few years while working on emails.


<h2> ⚡ More Random Things About Me:</h2>

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌻 I am a proud graduate of Randolph-Macon Woman's College and I am an Even. (This will make sense to other R-MWC/RC students and alumni.)
- 🐱 My cat is named Cleo. She is an 18-year-old, long-haired Calico fluff ball with an attitude. (She is a cat after all.) She is usually my profile pic across social media.
- 🧶 I love to knit, cross-stitch, and quilt. I alternate between them, often based on the weather. Sometimes it is too hot to knit.
- 👽 I am a PC gamer. Though I normally prefer simulator games (The Sims, Cities: Skylines, etc.) as they don't activate my motion sickness, I have a deep love for Alien: Isolation. I have played through it 9 times as of June 17, 2024 across all difficulty levels. I've gotten 100% of the achievements. I've even been doing some very casual speedrunning of it lately. I'm more focused on improving my own times as opposed to the actually-running-through-most-of-the-game official speedrunning styles. More power to those people but that's too much camera movement for me.

<h2 id="MyJobs"> 📧 What Did I Do as a Campaign Developer? </h2>

The TL;DR version is: [audience selection](#select), [receiving audience data files](#receive), [HTML](#html), [scheduling deployments](#schedule), [reporting](#report), [researching](#research), [documentation](#document), and various [group efforts](#group). 

<h3 id="select"> Audience Selection </h3>

 - I took the general selection criteria (e.g., households who last bought Barbies in the past 6-12 months but did not buy Legos) and used SQL (Oracle PL/SQL, SQL Server) to identify and select those records out of relational databases. 
 - I loaded the selected data into campaign software like Unica and built flowcharts to further refine and segment into specific groups with specific versions. 
 - Other times, I did all the refining and segmenting within SQL and then copied the data into a predefined final table for other groups to send the data to direct mail printers or another third-party provider. 
 - Sometimes, I applied the selection logic directly in the campaign software before segmenting, versioning, and sending it out. 

<h3 id="receive"> Receiving Audience Data Files </h3>

 - I received .csv audience files from other groups or the client and performed a rough data cleansing in Excel. I checked for invalid email formats, name or address fields containing "None" or "NULL", fields that were longer than allowed in the campaign platform, and more and then I fixed them. On some files, I had to look for email addresses with typos (e.g., gmial.com or yahoo.net) so I could fix those too. 
 - I matched the data to secondary files to pull in business versus personal flags.
 
<h3 id="html"> HTML </h3>

 - I received HTML from the creative team, uploaded their images into the campaign platform, uploaded and/or added the image paths, web links, alt text, and alias tags, done additional render testing, and scheduled the email for deployment. 
 - I received HTML from the U.S. version of an email and adapted it to deploy to Canada. I updated the spelling (e.g., noise-canceling to noise-cancelling), updated the product links (sometimes the products themselves) to the Canadian site, switched the navigation bar, footer, and disclosures to the Canadian versions. On rare occasions,I used Photoshop to update spelling in text that was part of an image. 
 - I received HTML the client provided and in addition to the regular process, I have cleaned up the HTML itself. This involved simple tasks of adding a "doc type" and a title tag to the code but also the more complex step of adding additional CSS to format the email for mobile versions. 

<h3 id="schedule"> Scheduling Deployments</h3>

 - I imported those cleansed files and HTML into the email platforms and scheduled the deployments.
  - I randomly split segments so that A/B testing could be done. Ideally, the platform could do it and I just needed to assign the control/test versions during scheduling. But more than once, I had to perform the split myself in Excel or SQL and then schedule the separate emails because the platform could not do either part.

<h3 id="report"> Reporting </h3>

 - I pulled reporting data from the email platforms, processed it in SQL, and exported those files to other groups to analyze and load in to dashboards. I have pulled the data from pre-built reporting dashboards in the platform and typed it into a more readable Excel report for the clients to view.
 - I set up extracts to run daily and export to a shared SFTP where another team could get them and send them to our company's dashboard.
 - I wrote SQL code to process data extracts and then output the data into an Excel report I built.
 - I processed data extracts to create smaller, specific post-deployment audience lists for the client that the platform could not produce itself.

<h3 id="research"> Researching </h3>

 - I have researched data inconsistencies by pulling data extracts and examining them in Excel and/or SQL to find patterns and identify the source of the problem.

<h3 id="document"> Documentation </h3>

 - I built expansive FIAs (file interface agreements) for vacation rental and pharmaceutical industry accounts so that not only did everyone know where and how files could be transferred, but also what fields were available and what was in those fields. 
 - I built an Excel workbook for a project on a large retail account where I was building daily extracts going from Salesforce Marketing Cloud to Power BI. The process began in the Canada business unit and ended in the U.S. unit. It involved 20+ automation steps due to the size and makeup of the database. My document included the names and locations of every query, data extension, data extract, and automation step. It also contained the queries themselves and a brief explanation of what should be happening in each step, making it far easier to compare queries.
 - I updated and expanded the campaign documentation for another retail account (health-focused) that had been started by a third-party contractor. I added information from an existing triggered email document, reformatted the style, reordered the sections to make more sense, fleshed out some sparse sections, reworded for clarity, and fixed typos, grammar, etc. 
 - I combined a set of multiple campaign documents into a single one for a travel industry account so that everything was in one place.  For example, you no longer had to wonder if the exporting extract information was in the "Importing a file to database and exporting a dtsx file" or "Mail List Extract Instructions" document.


<h3 id="group"> Group Efforts </h3>

 - I performed QA on team members' code, flowcharts, and scheduled deployments. I performed QA for the developers on their HTML.
 - I performed regression testing for a client's instance in SAP Hybris and built a shared testing log for our team to record our findings across two rounds.
 - I participated in updating 200+ HTML links and removing part of the AMPScript in triggered emails that were impacted by a client changing encryption methods.
